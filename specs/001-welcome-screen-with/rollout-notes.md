# Rollout Notes â€” Welcome Screen With Login and Signup

## Launch Overview
- **Configuration**: Welcome screen ships enabled by default for all unauthenticated users.
- **Impact**: Replaces the placeholder home experience with a branded entry point highlighting future login/signup availability.

## Enable Procedure
1. Merge the feature branch and build the release candidate.
2. Deploy to internal testers; confirm VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and reduced-motion interactions via manual QA checklist.
3. Monitor support channels for first-week feedback on messaging clarity.

## Disable / Rollback Procedure
1. Prepare a hotfix build that restores the prior welcome placeholder or hides CTAs temporarily.
2. Submit the hotfix through expedited review if needed.
3. Document the incident and plan follow-up tasks before re-enabling the experience.
