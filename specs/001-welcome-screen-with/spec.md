# Feature Specification: Welcome Screen With Login and Signup

**Feature Branch**: `001-welcome-screen-with`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Welcome screen with login and signup"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. On launch, detect unauthenticated state and render the welcome screen UI immediately.
2. Display Chill branding, headline copy summarizing value, and supporting illustration sourced from the design system.
3. Present two primary buttons labeled "Log In" and "Sign Up" with visual prominence and accessible labels.
4. Visually indicate that authentication is not yet available by pairing each button with secondary text such as "Feature coming soon" while keeping the buttons enabled.
5. When a user taps either button, allow standard touch feedback but keep the screen unchanged with no additional messaging or navigation.
6. Provide optional contextual help copy (e.g., "Existing members will receive access soon") to manage expectations.
7. Ensure the layout adapts to different device sizes, respects dynamic type, and remains usable offline since no network calls are triggered.
8. Skip analytics instrumentation for this interim UI-only release to avoid logging incomplete flows.
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- Communicate clearly that login and signup capabilities are planned but not yet active.
- Keep call-to-action buttons visually consistent with Chill's design system while signaling inactivity through helper text rather than disabling interaction feedback.
- Ensure accessibility: VoiceOver announces the intent and unavailable status; focus order follows reading order; color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA.
- Make all copy easy to update by content owners for future launches.
- Avoid triggering backend or analytics services until the full authentication experience ships.
- Prepare the UI so it can later enable real login/signup behavior without layout changes.

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: How should the inactive “Log In” and “Sign Up” buttons behave? → A: Buttons enabled, no action

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an unauthenticated user opening Chill, I see a welcoming experience that explains the app's value and informs me that login and signup will be available soon.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an unauthenticated user launches the app, **When** the welcome screen loads, **Then** they see Chill branding plus enabled "Log In" and "Sign Up" buttons accompanied by coming-soon messaging, and tapping them produces no further behavior.
2. **Given** a user taps either the "Log In" or "Sign Up" button, **When** the tap is processed, **Then** the user remains on the welcome screen with no additional messaging, maintaining the understanding that authentication will arrive in a future update via static copy.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when dynamic type is set to the largest size—do the buttons remain visible without clipping?
- How is the experience communicated for users relying on VoiceOver or other assistive technologies?
- What copy is shown if a user repeatedly taps the inactive buttons?
- How is localization handled for the coming-soon messaging?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST render the welcome screen for all unauthenticated users immediately after app launch, featuring Chill branding and value proposition copy.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display "Log In" and "Sign Up" buttons styled according to the design system while keeping them enabled and clearly signaling through helper text that actions are coming soon.
- **FR-003**: System MUST keep users on the welcome screen when either button is tapped and perform no further action beyond standard touch feedback.
- **FR-004**: System MUST expose copy blocks (headline, subcopy, button helper text) in a manner that allows marketing/content teams to update messaging without code changes.
- **FR-005**: System MUST meet accessibility expectations including VoiceOver labels that state the button purpose and unavailable status, sufficient color contrast, and dynamic type support.
- **FR-006**: System MUST operate fully offline because no network requests are executed from this screen.
- **FR-007**: System MUST omit analytics or tracking events for the inactive buttons until functional flows are built, preventing incomplete funnel data.
