# PR Notes â€” Welcome Screen With Login and Signup

- References: [Spec](spec.md), [Plan](plan.md)
- Welcome experience ships enabled by default; validate using standard simulator runs.
- Automated coverage currently includes `WelcomeViewModelTests` and `WelcomeViewSnapshotTests`; re-enable UI automation once Supabase login/signup is in place.
- Manual QA checklist captured in `quickstart.md`; rollout notes cover launch/rollback steps (no feature flag).
