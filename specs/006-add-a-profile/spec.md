## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: Which settings categories should be included on the profile page? ‚Üí A: Video preferences + Account security
- Q: Where should users access the profile page from in the app? ‚Üí A: User avatar/icon in top-right corner
- Q: What additional account information should be displayed beyond email, creation date, and verification status? ‚Üí A: Last login date + total videos saved count + display name/username
- Q: What is the acceptable profile page load time performance target? ‚Üí A: 3 seconds
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent settings updates from multiple devices? ‚Üí A: Last write wins - no conflict detection needed

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an authenticated user, I want to access a profile page where I can view my account information and manage my settings, so that I can control my experience and keep my account details up to date.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I navigate to the profile page, **Then** I see my basic account information displayed (email, account creation date, account status)

2. **Given** I am on the profile page, **When** I view the settings section, **Then** I see available settings organized in clear categories (Video Preferences and Account Security)

3. **Given** I am on the profile page, **When** I modify a setting, **Then** the change is saved and reflected immediately

4. **Given** I am not logged in, **When** I attempt to access the profile page, **Then** I am redirected to the login screen

5. **Given** I am on the profile page, **When** I navigate away and return, **Then** my information and settings are still accurate (no stale data)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when account data fails to load (network error, server error)?
- How does the system handle concurrent updates if the user modifies settings on multiple devices? (Last write wins - most recent save takes precedence)
- What happens if a setting value becomes invalid after being saved (e.g., deprecated option)?
- How does the page behave for users with incomplete profile information?
- What happens when the session expires while the user is viewing the profile page?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Profile Access
- **FR-001**: System MUST require authentication to access the profile page
- **FR-002**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users to the login screen when they attempt to access the profile page
- **FR-003**: System MUST load and display the current user's profile information when the page is accessed

#### Account Information Display
- **FR-004**: System MUST display the user's email address
- **FR-005**: System MUST display the account creation date
- **FR-006**: System MUST display the account verification status (verified/unverified)
- **FR-007**: System MUST display the user's display name or username
- **FR-008**: System MUST display the last login date and time
- **FR-009**: System MUST display the total count of videos saved by the user

#### Settings Management
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a settings section within the profile page organized into two categories: Video Preferences and Account Security
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide video preference settings including video quality (auto, high, medium, low) and autoplay behavior (on/off)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide account security settings including password change functionality
- **FR-013**: System MUST indicate which settings are editable vs. read-only
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate setting changes before saving (video quality must be one of allowed values, password must meet security requirements)
- **FR-015**: System MUST persist setting changes immediately when modified
- **FR-016**: System MUST use last-write-wins conflict resolution for concurrent setting updates from multiple devices (most recent save takes precedence)
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide visual feedback when a setting is successfully changed (confirmation message or indicator)
- **FR-018**: System MUST revert to previous value if a setting change fails to save

#### Account Actions
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide password change functionality within the Account Security settings section
- **FR-020**: System MUST require current password verification before allowing password change
- **FR-021**: System MUST enforce password requirements (minimum length, complexity) for new passwords
- **FR-022**: System MUST provide a way to sign out from the profile page

#### Data Loading and Error Handling
- **FR-023**: System MUST display a loading state while fetching profile information
- **FR-024**: System MUST show an appropriate error message if profile data fails to load
- **FR-025**: System MUST allow the user to retry loading if initial fetch fails
- **FR-026**: System MUST handle session expiration gracefully and redirect to login

#### Navigation and Layout
- **FR-027**: System MUST provide a user avatar/icon in the top-right corner of the application that opens the profile page when tapped
- **FR-028**: System MUST organize information in clear, scannable sections
- **FR-029**: System MUST provide navigation back to the main application from the profile page

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Profile page MUST load and display user information within 3 seconds under normal network conditions
- **NFR-002**: Profile page MUST be accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **NFR-003**: All account information MUST be displayed securely (no sensitive data in URLs or logs)

### Key Entities

- **User Profile**: Represents the authenticated user's account information including email, display name/username, account creation date, verification status, last login date, and total saved videos count
- **Video Preferences**: User settings controlling video playback behavior including quality preference (auto/high/medium/low) and autoplay setting (on/off)
- **Account Security**: Security-related settings and actions including password change functionality
- **Session**: Represents the authenticated state that grants access to the profile page
