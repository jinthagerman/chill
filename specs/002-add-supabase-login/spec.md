# Feature Specification: Supabase Login and Signup

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-supabase-login`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add Supabase login and signup"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Enable authenticated access for Chill by integrating Supabase Auth while preserving the existing welcome surface.
2. Support email/password signup, login, and logout with clear copy about account status, routing authenticated users to a placeholder `SavedLinksView`.
3. Respect Chill’s MVVM architecture by routing Supabase calls through view models/services and exposing auth state to SwiftUI views.
4. Provide resilient fallbacks and messaging when Supabase is unreachable or responses are delayed.
5. Capture analytics and logging for auth attempts without storing sensitive data.
6. Document accessibility, offline contingencies, and release procedures prior to implementation.
```

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: What password recovery flow should we implement? → A: In-app password reset via code delivered to email.
- Q: How long should a Supabase-authenticated session remain valid before forcing the user to reauthenticate? → A: Use Supabase defaults (refresh tokens keep users signed in until logout).
- Q: Do we need to support any providers beyond email/password? → A: Email/password only in this release.

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- Deliver a trustworthy first-login experience that keeps users informed of verification steps or errors.
- Maintain accessibility parity (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, reduced motion) for all authentication screens and dialogs.
- Keep the experience calm under unreliable connectivity—surface graceful retry options and preserve in-progress input locally.
- Observe privacy expectations: never log secrets, and ensure Supabase tokens are stored securely (Keychain) with clear lifecycle management.
- Plan rollout communications (copy, support readiness) even without feature flagging.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an unauthenticated Chill user, I can create or access my account through Supabase-powered login or signup so I can unlock the full Chill experience (currently represented by a Saved Links placeholder view) without leaving the app.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user on the welcome screen, **When** they select "Sign Up" and provide a valid email and password, **Then** their account is created via Supabase, they receive any required email confirmation instructions, and the app acknowledges next steps without exposing sensitive data.
2. **Given** a returning user with valid credentials, **When** they choose "Log In" and authenticate successfully, **Then** the app transitions them to `SavedLinksView` (placeholder authenticated home) while persisting session state for future launches.
3. **Given** a user who already has a valid Supabase session when the app launches, **When** the session is validated, **Then** the user bypasses the welcome screen and lands on `SavedLinksView` automatically.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Supabase Auth is unreachable during signup or login attempts?
- How is email confirmation communicated if Supabase requires verification before activation?
- How do we handle password reset requests or failed login attempts (e.g., rate limiting, lockouts)?
- What messaging appears when credentials are invalid or the account is disabled?
- How is state handled when a user switches devices or reinstalls the app?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to initiate account creation with email and password through Supabase Auth only, capturing any required consents and clearly signaling that other providers are unavailable in this release.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow existing users to authenticate via Supabase Auth and receive persistent sessions stored securely on-device, honoring Supabase’s default session/refresh behavior so users stay signed in until they explicitly log out.
- **FR-003**: System MUST route authenticated users (newly signed in or returning with a valid session) to a placeholder `SavedLinksView` screen that loads as the initial authenticated shell.
- **FR-004**: System MUST present inline, accessible error messaging for failed sign-in or sign-up attempts, including connectivity loss and Supabase error codes translated to user-friendly language.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a logout action that revokes the Supabase session and returns the user to the welcome state without leaving artifacts, including clearing any locally cached user metadata.
- **FR-006**: System MUST support an in-app password reset flow initiated from the welcome screen where Supabase emails a one-time code that the user enters to set a new password, with accessible copy guiding each step.
- **FR-007**: System MUST operate gracefully offline by preventing submission attempts when connectivity is unavailable and guiding users to retry later.
- **FR-008**: System MUST emit analytics/log entries for authentication attempts, successes, and failures while redacting PII and aligning with privacy policy. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specify required events, metrics, and retention]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **AuthSession**: Represents the authenticated state returned by Supabase (access token, refresh token, expiration, user metadata) and governs secure storage plus refresh rules.
- **AuthUserProfile**: Supabase user metadata the app displays (email, display name, verification status) and any Chill-specific onboarding flags.
- **AuthEvent**: Telemetry construct capturing auth attempt type, outcome, latency, and contextual device/network info while excluding credentials.
