## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: Does the backend authentication service provide a specific error code for duplicate email addresses during signup? ‚Üí A: Yes, backend returns a distinct error code (verified via Supabase implementation)
- Q: Should the system automatically save credentials to the device's password manager after successful signup, or should users be prompted to confirm first? ‚Üí A: OS default - Rely entirely on the operating system's standard password manager behavior
- Q: What should happen when a user navigates back from the initial choice screen? ‚Üí A: Stay on choice screen - There is nothing before authentication, so back navigation is prevented
- Q: When mismatched passwords are entered during signup, what specific error message should be displayed? ‚Üí A: "Passwords don't match"
- Q: What text should appear on the choice screen buttons for login and signup? ‚Üí A: "Sign In" and "Create Account"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a new user**, I want to select "Create Account" from an initial choice screen and proceed to a dedicated signup screen so I can clearly understand I'm creating a new account without confusion.

**As a returning user**, I want to select "Sign In" from an initial choice screen and proceed to a streamlined login screen so I can quickly authenticate without seeing irrelevant signup fields, and I want clear error messages so I understand what went wrong if authentication fails.

**As any user**, I want the system to integrate with my device's password manager so I can use saved credentials or securely generate and store new passwords, and I want to be able to go back to the choice screen if I selected the wrong option.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Initial Choice & Login Flow
1. **Given** a user launches the app and needs to authenticate, **When** they reach the authentication flow, **Then** they see an initial choice screen with "Sign In" and "Create Account" buttons
2. **Given** a returning user is on the choice screen, **When** they select "Sign In", **Then** they navigate to a dedicated login screen with email and password fields
3. **Given** a user is on the login screen, **When** they tap the email field, **Then** the system offers saved credentials from the device's password manager
4. **Given** a user enters invalid credentials, **When** they attempt to login, **Then** they see a specific error message (e.g., "That email or password looks incorrect") instead of a generic error
5. **Given** a user has not verified their email, **When** they attempt to login, **Then** they see "Verify your email before signing in" instead of a generic authentication error
6. **Given** a user is on the login screen, **When** they use the back navigation, **Then** they return to the initial choice screen

#### Signup Flow
7. **Given** a new user is on the choice screen, **When** they select "Create Account", **Then** they navigate to a dedicated signup screen with email, password, confirm password, and terms consent fields
8. **Given** a user is on the signup screen, **When** they tap the password field, **Then** the system offers to generate and save a strong password via the device's password manager
9. **Given** a user enters mismatched passwords, **When** they attempt to signup, **Then** they see the error message "Passwords don't match"
10. **Given** a user enters an already-registered email, **When** they attempt to signup, **Then** they see a clear error message indicating the email is already in use
11. **Given** a user successfully signs up, **When** the account is created, **Then** the operating system's password manager handles credential saving according to its standard behavior
12. **Given** a user is on the signup screen, **When** they use the back navigation, **Then** they return to the initial choice screen

#### Error Handling
13. **Given** a network error occurs during authentication, **When** the request fails, **Then** the user sees "We can't reach the server. Check your connection and try again." instead of a generic error
14. **Given** a user is rate-limited, **When** they attempt authentication, **Then** they see "Too many attempts. Please try again shortly." with information about when they can retry

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user navigates back from login or signup to the choice screen? (Form state is cleared per FR-033/034/035/036)
- How does the system handle password manager integration when multiple credentials are saved for the same app? (OS handles credential selection)
- What happens if the password manager is disabled or unavailable on the device? (Manual entry still works; autofill simply unavailable)
- How does the system handle authentication errors not explicitly mapped to user-friendly messages? (Fallback message per FR-026)
- What happens when a user submits the form while offline? (Prevented per FR-032, with offline message displayed)
- How does the system differentiate between "invalid credentials" errors from the backend (wrong password vs. email not found)? (Both map to same user-friendly message per FR-020 for security)

## Requirements
